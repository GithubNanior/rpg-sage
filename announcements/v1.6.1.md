# RPG Sage - v1.6.1 Patch / Bug Fix
This update addresses the following issues:
- Stats command eating stats
- Too Many Aliases, Macros, Stats won't post
- Weather Command - Temperatures
- Random Selection Recursion Error
- Other Bugs
 - there are a number of behind the scenes things getting sorted

## What happened to other things that were supposed to be in this patch?
As testing went on, we found a handful of things that needed fixing. As fixing went on, we pulled a couple threads and lost our sweater. We were getting annoyed with how long it was taking ... so we decided to push v1.6.1 now.

We already have v1.6.2 partially done and about to go to beta.
