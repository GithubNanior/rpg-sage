# Patch: v1.6.13b

Hello @everyone!

We just pushed a quick patch and wanted to let you know about it.

We were getting errors from Discord telling us that usernames are not allowed to have the word "discord" in the name.
We have patched the code so that any attempt to do so will now reply to your command telling you as much.

We tested it wit words such as "discordance" and the error occurs, but you can get away with "d1scordance" *(number 1 instead of i)*.
