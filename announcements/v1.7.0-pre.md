# Version: v1.7.0 *(tomorrow)*

Hello @everyone!

Our next update has passed regression testing in Dev and in Beta and is ready for Stable!

We are planning to push it live tomorrow morning when we get to a computer so that we are around all day in case something unforeseen goes wrong.

This release offers nothing new to users. What it does do is update our Discord API to the latest code, enabling us to take full advantage of all the latest and greatest features (such as Polls). We also redid a number of our own utility libraries so that we can start creating and testing updates for things much faster and more reliably than we have in the past.

We expect only minimal downtime as this doesn't make any changes to the server nor the existing data, we simply need to pull the new code, update the dependencies, build it, and fire it up.

We are currently planning to push the update at <t:1721923200:f>.
