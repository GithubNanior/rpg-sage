# RPG Sage - v1.6.3 Patch / Bug Fix

## Wait, what happened to v1.6.2 ??

It was ready to go and then a couple very serious bugs were found and fixed and so the whole system was pushed during a time we were super busy and we forgot to announce it.

## What is v1.6.3 ??

Well, it had a couple things missing from v1.6.2 that weren't ready at the time we needed to release it. It also contains a major overhaul to our Game Create and Update commands ... including new Slash Commands!

> NOTE: The old game management commands no longer function the way they used to, due to a couple of changes. There were some serious issues under the hood that simply *HAD* to be corrected if we were going to make RPG Sage be better than it was. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience.

Please see the following pages at our new Wiki to familiarize yourself with the new command options:
