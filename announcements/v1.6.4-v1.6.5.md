# This Week in RPG Sage

We've released a few patches over the past week or so.

### v1.6.5 Modified Game Slash Commands

- We fixed a bug with the diceSecret option.
- We have updated the Game slash commands to make channels, gms, and players mentionables and easier to fill in.

### v1.6.4 More Stat Math

- When using stats in dice, you can now perform min, max, floor, ceil, round.

Ex:
```
[1d20 + min({pc::mod.dex},{pc::mod.str})]
[1d20 + max({pc::mod.dex},{pc::mod.str})]
```
### Misc Bug Fixes

- Fix some dialog name issues
- Fix some "delete this message" button issues

### GPL-3.0-only

- RPG Sage officially falls under GNU General Public License, Version 3
