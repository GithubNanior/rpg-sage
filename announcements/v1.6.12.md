# Update: v1.6.12

Happy Humpday @everyone!

### Bugs

**Pathbuilder Import Alignment Removed**
Pathfinder 2e removed alignment.
Sage's map movement was using `[N]` to mean North.
Imported Pathbuilder characters with N alignment showed the tag `[N]`.
This `[N]` got converted to the :arrow_up: used for map movement.

I stopped displaying alignment on imported character sheets to avoid this issue.

### Requests

**Allow Inline Dice as Default**
- in dialog, `[[]]` triggers inline dice results
 - *results are shown in place of roll instead of follow up post*
- now, you can toggle a setting to tell Sage you switch `[]` to inline
- `sage! user set dialogDiceBehavior="inline"`

**@Character converted to @User**
- if Sage finds @Alias in dialog, it will try to find that character
- if found, the output will be: Character Name (@Player)
- if the character is an NPC, then the GM will be mentioned

**NoSort default for games**
- you can now set `diceSort` on channel, game, and server
 - `diceSort="sort"`
 - `diceSort="noSort"`
- this will override Sage's default action of sorting dice results
