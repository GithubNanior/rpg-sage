@everyone Hey all, I have a good reason for the ping ... again!

1. I have walked through all the old documentation to make sure that everything has made its way to the new wiki.

2. I have walked the code and I think I have added all the missing bits.

3. I have given most of it a new facelift that should make it a bit easier to read/follow, and is more consistent, but this is where you all come in ... let's make it better for everybody.

The main page is [here](<https://github.com/rpg-sage-creative/rpg-sage/wiki>). Please check it out and let me know what you think. Love it or Hate it. Won't Use it or Glued to it. We need to know what works and what doesn't so that we can make RPG Sage as easy to use as possible. If you want to help compare, the old docs are still at <https://rpgsage.io>.

As soon as I am certain I have everything and it is easy to read, I will be updating the old site with a copy of this wiki.

Please drop by our Discord and share your thoughts: [Public Link to our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pfAcUMN)

Thank You, and Happy Gaming!
