			"Mighty drow noble houses, including House Shraen, use this ritual to stamp out fledgling noble houses before they rise to power. At the ritual's completion, you place a contagious wasting disease upon the target creature with the intention of ending their familial bloodline.",
			"The ritual is easiest to cast on a subdued target, typically a low-ranking member of the targeted family bloodline who is kidnapped and has their memory wiped. If the target is conscious when the ritual is cast, the target attempts a Fortitude save against the ritual's DC; on a success, the ritual fails. Otherwise, the target is automatically affected by the dying bloodline disease.",
			"<b>Dying Bloodline</b> (curse, disease) Failing or critically failing this disease's Fortitude save causes the disease to progress to the next stage as normal; however, succeeding or critically succeeding at the save has no effect. The disease can be removed only by first successfully counteracting the curse and then counteracting the disease; <b>Level</b> equal to twice the ritual's level; <b>Stage 1</b> carrier with no effect (1 month); <b>Stage 2</b> fatigued (1 week); <b>Stage 3</b> fatigued and drained 1 (1 day); <b>Stage 4</b> fatigued and drained 3 (1 day); <b>Stage</b> 5 death.",
