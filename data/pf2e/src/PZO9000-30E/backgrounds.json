			"You remember the day the stranger approached you to make several peculiar inquiries. You don't remember much about them, other than a large head and a frail body. At first, the stranger's questions seemed odd: how might forgotten history nevertheless shape the present, whether an insect hive mind could be manipulated at a distance, and so on. You don't remember all of the questions, and you don't know why you could refuse to answer some but felt compelled to answer others. The stranger nevertheless seemed pleased with your responses and insisted you would find study at the Magaambya enlightening. You never saw them again, but you're now here at the Magaambya, with more questions than answers about your future.",

They are pleasant people and well-regarded in Nantambu, although their unshakable generosity and friendliness strike cynics as too earnest to be genuine. You know otherwise; Takulu and Niana are just as sincere as they appear. Takulu always seemed to watch you with a discerning eye, and one day he idly observed that you'd do well at the Magaambya. Talkingaboutitfurtherwithhim,Takulu agreed that he would sponsor you personally and be the one to give your intake interview. With a twinkle in his eye, he asked that you call him Teacher Ot from now on, just as all of his students do.",
