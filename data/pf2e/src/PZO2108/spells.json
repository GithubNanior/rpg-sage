Additionally, you appear to mimic their skill, although such appearances are merely an illusion. If they are famous for physical art, the spell creates illusions of physical artwork matching their style, and onlookers who don't disbelieve are convinced these works are as impressive as the real thing. If they are famous for their ability to perform, you create an illusory performance that tricks onlookers into thinking you are as skillful as the performer you're pretending to be. The audience can disbelieve this spell if they interact with your art or actively listen to the performance, using either Perception or an appropriate Lore, whichever is higher. When the duration ends, any fake art disappears, and those who were duped by a performance realize it wasn't as good as they thought, though they still might not discover that you weren't really the artist you claimed to be.",

Using the spell to maintain the ruse long enough to Earn Income from your art is also quite diffcult; because it requires careful timing and repeated deceit, it can't be assumed to automatically work on an Earn Income check."

After Pushing Off a surface, the creature continues to move the same distance at the start of each of its turns until it leaves the area or Pushes Off against something else. A creature pushing against an untethered object of its size or smaller causes both the creature and the object to move at the same speed, but in opposite directions. Creatures who can levitate or fly can use those abilities to move around in the area without having to push off anything. Creatures who can't levitate or fly are usually on the ground, giving them a surface from which to push off.",
			"You can Dismiss this spell. When <i>zero gravity</i> ends, all creatures and objects in the area fall back down."
