			"Certain martial artists dedicate themselves to fighting in Jalmeray's Challenge of Sky and Heaven; these individuals devote themselves to the esoteric mysteries of the sky and incorporate these lofty abilities into their martial arts maneuvers. You may have learned these skills from the Houses of Perfection in Jalmeray, or from a practitioner of this style who left Jalmeray bearing its secrets (such as Shristi Melipdra). The Houses of Perfection focus on honing elemental powers, but the Jalmeri heavenseeker isn't limited by the powers of air alone. This style's attacks emulate darting flashes of lightning and the crash of thunder from roiling storm clouds. A true practitioner masters control even over dense matter, causing the air to support its weight or bring it crashing down."
