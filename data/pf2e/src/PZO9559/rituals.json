			"You perform a complex magical operation on a willing or restrained creature or a corpse, delicately cutting into the skull and removing the creature's brain without damaging the organ. If you have an empty <i>brain cylinder</i> on hand, you can place the extracted brain into the <i>brain cylinder</i> as part of this ritual (this includes preparing the <i>brain cylinder</i> for use, such as removing a previous brain and filling the cylinder with the preservative fluids required to make it function). Or at the GM's discretion, if you have a nearly completed carrion golem at hand, you can place the extracted brain into the golem. The body of a living creature subjected to this ritual dies, regardless of the ritual's result, as does the extracted brain if it is not placed into a golem or cylinder (or otherwise preserved) within 3 rounds.",
