			"Setting up a camp in the Mwangi Jungle takes about an hour and requires one PC to attempt a secret DC 22 Survival check to determine the quality of the campsite. Utilizing Ekujae mosquito netting they provide grants the PC a +2 circumstance bonus to this Survival check. At your option, other precautions taken by the PCs can instead grant this bonus, but multiple tactics are not cumulative. Certain magic spells like <i>magnificent mansion</i> or <i>rope trick</i>, or magic items like an <i>instant fortress</i>, can create shelters that result in an automatic success at camping in dangerous terrain like the Mwangi Jungle, but at this point in their adventuring careers, the PCs are unlikely to have access to this type of magic. This activity assumes the PCs are resting for 8 hours.",

				"criticalSuccess": [
					"The camp serves the PCs well, allowing them to rest and make their daily preparations upon waking without difficulty. The camp is also camouflaged or protected, and as a result, there is no chance of a random encounter while the PCs rest."

					"The camp serves the PCs well, allowing them to rest and make their daily preparations upon waking without difficulty."

				"failure": [
					"The camp doesn't effectively prevent insects, rain, and other unpleasant jungle elements from reaching the PCs. The PCs can still rest and make their daily preparations, but each PC is also exposed to dysentery (see sidebar)."
				],
				"criticalFailure": [
					"The camp is an utter mess. The PCs are exposed to both dysentery and malaria (see sidebar). In addition, they gain no benefit from rest during the time spent camping, and they instead become fatigued."
