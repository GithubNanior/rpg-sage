			"Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the back rooms of esoteric shops to swap secrets of their trade. In such meetings, a different kind of magic may strike: the spark of innovation! The mixing of magical techniques produces fascinating and unpredictable results. As one of these innovators, sometimes called a spell trickster, you have a knack for pioneering magical techniques and discovering new effects from spells most novice spellcasters take for granted. Whether your unique abilities are the result of weeks of experimentation or a secret passed to you by a traveling practitioner, you delight in surprising others with your tricks."
