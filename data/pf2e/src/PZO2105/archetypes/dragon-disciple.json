			"<b>Instinct of the Wyrm</b> The acquisition of draconic might can change the dragon disciple's body and give them magical abilities, as reflected in the archetype's feats, but the mind often changes as well, potentially even overwhelming the disciple's normal personality. Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority.",
			"Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants.",
			"Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation. This can bring on the full mindset of a dragon, or even make the disciple temporarily believe they truly are a dragon, and is often accompanied by a draconic roar, cackle, or majestic display."
