			"You have a specific disguise that you keep at the ready, worn underneath your outer garment. You can change into this disguise to Impersonate as a 3-action activity. If you have master proficiency in Deception, it is instead a 2-action activity, and if you have legendary proficiency, it is a single action. You can create a new backup disguise by spending the normal amount of time it takes you to Impersonate, but you can have only one backup disguise at a time. Having a backup disguise doesn't allow you to remove your armor or any other complex piece of clothing any more quickly, but once you have those off, the disguise is readily available. Because you have the backup disguise at the ready, it's possible that a thorough search might reveal some elements of the disguise (see Conceal an Object in the Stealth skill)."

			"You have a small group of admirers who tend to follow you around while you're in civilized settlements. Your admirers are helpful to you, allowing you to make simple Requests of them such as purchasing basic equipment with your funds or finding a room at an inn. These admirers do not travel with you to places that are obviously dangerous, including most adventure locations, but they'll wait for you at the nearest settlement. Your admirers never use actions in encounter mode other than to retreat, and they abandon you if you intentionally bring them harm or at the GM's discretion. When you Gather Information, you can use your admirers to assist you, granting a +1 circumstance bonus to your Diplomacy check and reducing the time it takes even further (typically to 30 minutes, rather than 1 hour with the Hobnobber feat alone). If you have the Sow Rumor feat, you can have your admirers assist you, with the same benefits as Gather Information."
