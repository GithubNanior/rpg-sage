			"body": "Some rangers believe civilization wears down the soul, but still needs to be protected from wild creatures. Others say nature needs to be protected from the greedy, who wish to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts, haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off the land and are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies.\n\n**Key Ability: STRENGTH OR DEXTERITY**\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.\n\n**Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier**\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\n\n#### Warden Spells\nYour relationship with the world around you extends from the physical to the magical. Certain feats grant you warden spells, which are a type of focus spells. It costs 1 Focus Point (FP) to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first warden spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 FP. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 FP by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with nature.\n\nYour warden spells are primal spells. When you first gain a warden spell, you become trained in primal spell attacks and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is Wisdom. \n\nFocus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 FP. The full rules for focus spells appear here.\n\n#### Key Terms\nYou'll see these key terms in many ranger class features. \n\n**Flourish**: Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. \n\n**Open**: These maneuvers work only as the first salvo in the attacks you make on your turn. You can use an action with the open trait only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn. \n\n**Press**: Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.\n\nSome actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)\n\n#### Roleplaying the Ranger\n\n\n#### During Combat Encounters...\nYou can single out particular foes to hunt, making you better at defeating them. You target and brutalize your chosen foe with either a bow or melee weapons, while supporting your allies with your skills.\n\n#### During Social Encounters...\nWhen you speak, it's with the voice of practical experience, especially involving wilderness exploration.\n\n#### While Exploring...\nYou guide your allies through the wilderness or follow tracks. You keep an eye out for trouble, constantly alert for danger even when it's not overt.\n\n#### In Downtime...\nYou craft weapons and train animals in preparation for your next venture. If you prefer to get outside, you might go on hunts or scout nearby areas to better understand your environment.\n\n#### You Might...\n+ Respect the raw power of nature and understand how to make the best of its bounty. \n+ Enjoy the thrill of the hunt. \n+ Scout out ahead of the party, reconnoitering dangers before combat begins.\n\n#### Others Probably...\n+ Call upon you to protect them from the wilds or the encroachment of civilization. \n+ Expect you to be a quiet or taciturn loner. \n+ Think there is something dangerous and wild about you.\n\n#### Initial Proficiencies\nAt 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

You also ignore the penalty for making ranged attacks within your second range increment against the prey you're hunting.\n\nYou can have only one creature designated as your prey at a time.

Your designation lasts until your next daily preparations.\n\n#### Hunter's Edge\nYou have trained for countless hours to become a more skilled hunter and tracker, gaining an additional benefit when you Hunt Prey depending on the focus of your training.

You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\n\n#### Ancestry Feats (5th)\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry in Chapter 2.\n\n#### Ranger Weapon Expertise (5th)\nYou've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons.

Enemies are flat-footed to you if they're in natural difficult terrain or in difficult terrain resulting from a snare.\n\n#### Ranger Expertise (9th)\nYou've practiced your techniques to make them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your ranger class DC increases to expert.\n\n#### Juggernaut (11th)\nYour body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments.

Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.\n\n#### Masterful Hunter (17th)\nYou have honed your abilities as a hunter to incredible levels.

You also gain an additional benefit depending on your hunter's edge.\n\nSee specific hunter's edges for more information.\n\n#### Second Skin (19th)\nYour armor has become akin to a second skin for you. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master. When wearing light or medium armor, you can rest normally, rather than receiving poor rest that leaves you fatigued.\n\n#### Swift Prey (19th)\nYou size up your prey with only a glance. You can use Hunt Prey as a free action if it's your first action of your turn.",
