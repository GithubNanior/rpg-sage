			"body": "You are skilled and opportunistic. Using your sharp wits and quick reactions, you take advantage of your opponents' missteps and strike where it hurts most. You play a dangerous game, seeking thrills and testing your skills, and likely don't care much for any laws that happen to get in your way. While the path of every rogue is unique and riddled with danger, the one thing you all share in common is the breadth and depth of your skills.\n\n**Key Ability: DEXTERITY OR OTHER**\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity or an option from rogue's racket.\n\n**Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier**\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\n\n#### Key Terms\nYou'll see the following key terms in many rogue class features.\n\n**Debilitation**: Debilitations apply conditions and other negative effects to a creature. When the creature is affected by a new debilitation, any previous one it was affected by ends.\n\n**Flourish**: Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.\n\n#### Roleplaying the Rogue\n\n\n#### During Combat Encounters...\nYou move about stealthily so you can catch foes unawares. You're a precision instrument, more useful against a tough boss or distant spellcaster than against rank-and-file soldiers.\n\n#### During Social Encounters...\nYour skills give you multiple tools to influence your opposition. Pulling cons and ferreting out information are second nature to you.\n\n#### While Exploring...\nYou sneak to get the drop on foes and scout for danger or traps.

You can also become part of a thieves' guild, or even found one of your own.\n\n#### You Might...\n+ Hone your skills through intense practice, both on your own and out in the world. \n+ Know where to attain illicit goods. \n+ Skirt or break the law because you think it's meaningless or have your own code.\n\n#### Others Probably...\n+ Find you charming or fascinating, even if they think they know better than to trust you. \n+ Come to you when they need someone who is willing to take risks or use questionable methods. \n+ Suspect you're motivated primarily by greed.\n\n#### Initial Proficiencies\nAt 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\n\n#### Rogue Feats\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a rogue class feat.\n\n#### Rogue's Racket\nAs you started on the path of the rogue, you began to develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities. Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way you approach a job, while building your reputation in the criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in order to cover all the bases. Choose a rogue's racket. \n\nRackets can be found here\n\n#### Skill Feats\nYou gain skill feats more often than others. At 1st level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait.\n\n#### Sneak Attack\nWhen your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, or a ranged weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.\n\nAs your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.\n\n#### Surprise Attack\nYou spring into combat faster than foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are flat-footed to you.\n\n#### Skill Increases (2nd)\nYou gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.\n\nAt 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\n\n#### Deny Advantage (3rd)\nAs someone who takes advantage of others' defenses, you are careful not to leave such openings yourself. You aren't flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.\n\n#### General Feats (3rd)\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.\n\n#### Ability Boosts (5th)\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\n\n#### Ancestry Feats (5th)\nIn addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry in Chapter 2.\n\n#### Weapon Tricks (5th)\nYou have become thoroughly familiar with the tools of your trade. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, as well as the rapier, sap, shortbow, and shortsword. When you critically succeed at an attack roll against a flat-footed creature while using an agile or finesse simple weapon or any of the listed weapons, you apply the critical specialization effect for the weapon you're wielding.\n\n#### Evasion (7th)\nYou've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragons' breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.\n\n#### Vigilant Senses (7th)\nThrough your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.\n\n#### Weapon Specialization (7th)\nYou've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you're a master, and 4 damage if you're legendary.\n\n#### Debilitating Strikes (9th)\nWhen taking advantage of an opening, you both hinder and harm your foe. You gain the Debilitating Strike free action.\n\n#### Debilitating Strike\nYou apply one of the following debilitations, which lasts until the end of your next turn. \n\n+ **Debilitation** The target takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. \n+ **Debilitation** The target becomes enfeebled 1.\n\n#### Great Fortitude (9th)\nYour physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\n\n#### Rogue Expertise (11th)\nYour techniques are now harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your rogue class DC increases to expert.\n\n#### Improved Evasion (13th)\nYou elude danger to a degree that few can match. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.\n\n#### Incredible Senses (13th)\nYou notice things almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.\n\n#### Light Armor Expertise (13th)\nYou've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.\n\n#### Master Tricks (13th)\nYou've mastered a rogue's fighting moves. Your proficiency ranks increase to master for all simple weapons and unarmed attacks plus the rapier, sap, shortbow, and shortsword.\n\n#### Double Debilitation (15th)\nYour opportunistic attacks are particularly detrimental. When you use Debilitating Strike, you can apply two debilitations simultaneously; removing one removes both.\n\n#### Greater Weapon Specialization (15th)\nYour damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.\n\n#### Slippery Mind (17th)\nYou play mental games and employ cognitive tricks to throw off mind-altering effects. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\n\n#### Light Armor Mastery (19th)\nYour skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.\n\n#### Master Strike (19th)\nYou can incapacitate an unwary foe with a single strike. Your proficiency rank for your rogue class DC increases to master. You gain the Master Strike free action.\n\n#### Master Strike\nThe target attempts a Fortitude save at your class DC. It then becomes temporarily immune to your Master Strike for 1 day.\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n**Success** The target is enfeebled 2 until the end of your next turn.\n**Failure** The target is paralyzed for 4 rounds.\n**Critical Failure** The target is paralyzed for 4 rounds, knocked unconscious for 2 hours, or killed (your choice).",
