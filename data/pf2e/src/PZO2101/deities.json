			"body": "Abadar is worshipped as the god of cities, law, merchants, and wealth. Abadar's cathedral-banks are found in many cities and places where order thrives or is gaining a foothold. Aristocrats, city guards, merchants, and those working in legal practice or who have the well-being of their community on their mind are common worshippers of the god of cities, along with dwarves in general. Abadaran priests living in cities often serve as judges, lawyers, and clerks, while those who live on the frontier work as roving magistrates, acting as judge, jury, and executioners in the name of order.\n\n\n**Edicts** bring civilization to the frontiers, earn wealth through hard work and trade, follow the rule of law\n**Anathema** engage in banditry or piracy, steal, undermine a law-abiding court\n**Areas of Concern** cities, law, merchants, and wealth\n**Follower Alignments** LG, LN, LE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Constitution or Intelligence\n**Divine Font** harm or heal\n**Divine Skill** Society\n**Favored Weapon** crossbow\n**Domains** cities, earth, travel, wealth\n**Alternate Domains** duty\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: illusory object, 4th: creation, 7th: magnificent mansion\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nAbadar's gifts take the form of riches, while his ire tends to cause offenders to lose wealth.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Abadar warns his favored against those who might unfairly take advantage. Once, when someone rolls a success on a Deception check to Lie maliciously to you and you alone, they get a critical failure instead. Abadar typically chooses to grant this boon in response to an extremely consequential lie.\n**Moderate Boon**: Abadar blesses all your enterprises, leading to financial success as all your ventures always seems to work out. If you roll a critical failure at a check to Earn Income, you get a failure instead. If you roll a success on a check to Earn Income, you earn twice the usual amount of income.\n**Major Boon**: Your silver tongue is infallible, allowing you to reach a compromise if one is even remotely possible. Once per day, you know just what to offer to make a deal or broker a negotiation, and if you offer your divinely inspired deal, you can automatically receive a result of 20 + your Diplomacy modifier on your Diplomacy check instead of rolling. This does not increase your degree of success like rolling a 20 would. If there is legitimately nothing you could offer to reach an agreement, you learn that, and you don't expend your daily use of the boon.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Any time you steal, illegally harm or kill another creature, or undermine a law-abiding officer or court, a symbol or word describing your crime appears on a visible spot on your skin. This symbol cannot be removed or hidden with makeup (though it can be covered with clothing) and it doesn't vanish until you make legal restitution for the crime, such as by serving your sentence.\n**Moderate Curse**: Abadar curses all your enterprises, leading to financial disaster as all your ventures always seem to fail. The result of your check to Earn Income is always one degree of success worse than the one you rolled.\n**Major Curse**: You become honest to a fault. You constantly suffer the critical failure effect of zone of truth. Additionally, you are always offered the worst possible option in a bargain.",

If Asmodeus's own scriptures are to believed-and they are corroborated by certain other accounts, like the angel-penned Book of the Damned-he is one of the oldest beings of the multiverse. These texts claim that in time before time, in a world not yet created, Asmodeus and his brother Ihys were among the first gods in existence. During these unnamed ages, the two gods quarreled over the fate of the souls of their creations, and Asmodeus slew his brother. Confident that Ihys's act of granting mortals free will was folly, Asmodeus made his own convictions known: that existence is best served by absolute order and discipline. These claims contradict other popular creation myths, and both theologians and immortal agents of the gods doubt Asmodeus's claims to varying degrees, but while there is no evidence to prove them, they are also difficult to refute.\n\n**Edicts** negotiate contracts to your best advantage, rule tyrannically and torture weaker beings, show subservience to your betters\n**Anathema** break a contract, free a slave, insult Asmodeus by showing mercy to your enemies\n**Areas of Concern** contracts, pride, slavery, and tyranny \n**Follower Alignments** LE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** any, though characters who commit themselves to Asmodeus this way have their souls bound to the Dark Prince for all eternity\n**Divine Font** harm\n**Divine Skill** Deception\n**Favored Weapon** mace\n**Domains** confidence, fire, trickery, tyranny\n**Alternate Domains** duty, glyph\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: charm, 4th: suggestion, 6th: mislead\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nAsmodeus tends to offer his gifts to entice those on the precipice of yielding to his vile temptations. His curses come most often in response to those who break contracts in his name, or commit other personal insults.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Pleased by your talent for manipulation, Asmodeus amplifies your skills. Once, when you fail at the Diplomacy check to make a significant or consequential Request, you can cast suggestion on the target of your Request, suggesting the same course of action. This is a divine innate spell.\n**Moderate Boon**: Your eyes glow red like embers and your skin takes on a crimson tone. You gain darkvision and fire resistance 5.\n**Major Boon**: Asmodeus helps enforce your bargains and contracts. When a creature enters a bargain or contract with you, uncoerced and of its own free will, it can't voluntarily violate its side of the bargain as long as you uphold your side. You can always choose to violate the bargain yourself, but if you do, the creature is no longer bound to fulfill its part.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Asmodeus's flames burn you with great malice. You gain weakness 5 to fire.\n**Moderate Curse**: Asmodeus forces your compliance. You can't voluntarily back out of an agreement or contract or go back on your word, though you need follow only the letter of the agreement, not the spirit.\n**Major Curse**: Asmodeus has taken note of the chaos you have wrought. You receive an ancient wound that feels older than time itself. You become permanently drained 4, and nothing short of another intercession can remove the condition. Your wound aches fiercely whenever you perform a particularly chaotic act, causing you to become sickened 1.",

In his mortal years, Cayden was a sellsword of no small fame, known for his boisterous manner, skill with a blade, and fearless resolve. During a particularly rowdy night of drinking, a series of escalating dares led the wandering mercenary to attempt the Test of the Starstone. He emerged from the Starstone Cathedral 3 days later, laughing, a fully realized god. Divine responsibility did little to change Cayden's attitude from what it was in his mortal life. He continues to crave adventure, drink, and pleasurable company while abhorring bullies, tyrants, and cowards.\n\n**Edicts** drink, free slaves and aid the oppressed, seek glory and adventure\n**Anathema** waste alcohol, be mean or standoffish when drunk, own a slave\n**Areas of Concern** ale, bravery, freedom, and wine\n**Follower Alignments** NG, CG, CN\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Constitution or Charisma\n**Divine Font** heal\n**Divine Skill** Athletics\n**Favored Weapon** rapier\n**Domains** cities, freedom, indulgence, might\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: fleet step, 2nd: touch of idiocy, 5th: hallucination\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nCayden sometimes hands out his blessings and communicates his ire at seemingly random opportunities based on his drunken whims. In particular, Cayden blesses the recently liberated to help secure their freedom. Cayden is also known to grant particularly trivial and harmless curses to those who disrupt revelry. These curses typically cause the disruptor to change in appearance, taking on a comical or farcical look. He is quick to lift these curses by dawn or for those who give in to the enjoyment of the evening and join the festivities.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Cayden Cailean helps you recover from nights of carousing. While you still get drunk and otherwise experience the effects of alcohol normally, you are never hung over the next morning.\n**Moderate Boon**: You share some of the bravery Cayden espoused during his ascension. When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. If you have the fighter bravery class feature, when you roll a critical failure on a save against a fear effect, you get a failure instead.\n**Major Boon**: An embodiment of freedom, you break fetters with ease. At the end of each of your turns, you can end one effect that is currently making you immobilized (including effects that make you immobilized by grabbing or restraining you) as a free action.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Individuals who raise Cayden's passing displeasure awake as if from a hard night of drinking and find that drink tastes foul.\n**Moderate Curse**: Cayden has afflicted you with cowardice. Whenever you roll a critical success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a success instead, and each time you roll a failure on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical failure instead.\n**Major Curse**: Cayden curses you to suffer in the presence of drinking, making it hard for you to bear entering any tavern. Whenever any creature drinks alcohol within 100 feet of you, you suffer all negative effects from the alcohol (but only the alcohol) instead. This doesn't apply if the creature gains any special effect from drinking alcohol.",

You must always roll twice and take the worst result when attempting a check. This is a misfortune effect. You can express your remorse and ignore this effect for 1d4 rounds by spending an action, which has the concentrate trait.

Sailors drop boxes of cargo as offerings to avoid a fatal storm, hoping to please the Wind and the Waves, even though they know that such pleas are far more likely to go unnoticed as they are to draw their deity's attention. The deity's temperament is fickle and their fury swift, hurling bolts of lightning and dragging to the crushing depths those who dare befoul the natural world. Gozreh is the sea that encapsulates the land and the wind that moves its surface, the birds that traverse the sky and the clouds that shield them.\n\n**Edicts** cherish, protect, and respect nature in all its forms\n**Anathema** bring civilization to intrude on the wild, create undead, despoil areas of natural beauty\n**Areas of Concern** nature, the sea, and weather\n**Follower Alignments** NG, LN, N, CN, NE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Constitution or Wisdom\n**Divine Font** heal\n**Divine Skill** Survival\n**Favored Weapon** trident\n**Domains** air, nature, travel, water\n**Alternate Domains** cold, lightning\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: gust of wind, 3rd: lightning bolt, 5th: control water\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nGozreh is pleased when their creatures and waterways are treated with respect but quick to show their displeasure.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Gozreh grants their guidance while at sea. You are under the constant effects of know direction and become trained in Sailing Lore (or another Lore skill if you are already trained in Sailing Lore).\n**Moderate Boon**: You gain the touch of the sea. You can breathe underwater and gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed.\n**Major Boon**: Gozreh has blessed you with their wind in your stride. You gain a +30-foot status bonus to your Speeds, and you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Lightning begins to strike twice. You gain weakness 5 to electricity, and any natural or magical bolts of lightning always target you rather than the other creatures around you.\n**Moderate Curse**: The current of the waves constantly fights against you, putting you at risk of drowning any time you must Swim. You lose any swim Speed you have, unless it's your only Speed, in which case you take a -20-foot status penalty to your swim Speed. When you roll an Athletics check to Swim, you always use the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of your roll.\n**Major Curse**: Those who displease Gozreh are shunned by nature itself. All animals and nonsapient plant creatures are hostile to you, and any animal companion or familiar abandons you. Sapient plants' attitude toward you begins two categories worse than normal, as something about you seems repugnant to them. While plants and animals might not attack you outright if it's not normally in their nature to do so when they are hostile, dogs growl at you, cats hiss, and so on.",

Born in Cheliax, she followed the path of the sword and fought evil, eventually becoming a paladin of Aroden's herald Arazni. She became a legend among the Shining Crusade, leading the Knights of Ozem in a series of victories over the Whispering Tyrant. Iomedae became the third known mortal to pass the Test of the Starstone when she ascended to divinity in 3832 AR. As Arazni had been slain during the Shining Crusade, Aroden elevated the newly ascended goddess to be his new herald. When Aroden himself died, Iomedae inherited most of his worshippers and became a major deity of honor and justice.\n\n**Edicts** be temperate, fight for justice and honor, hold valor in your heart\n**Anathema** abandon a companion in need, dishonor yourself, refuse a challenge from an equal\n**Areas of Concern** honor, justice, rulership, and valor\n**Follower Alignments** LG, NG\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Strength or Constitution\n**Divine Font** heal\n**Divine Skill** Intimidation\n**Favored Weapon** longsword\n**Domains** confidence, might, truth, zeal\n**Alternate Domains** duty\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: true strike, 2nd: enlarge, 4th: fire shield\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nIomedae grants her blessings to those who show valor in trying times.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: You always present yourself at your best. Your clothing and person are always clean and unrumpled, the metal of your blade and armor shining and unblemished. This doesn't prevent you from being exposed to diseases and other afflictions via filth, but it protects you as well as if you had washed thoroughly right away.\n**Moderate Boon**: Your heart beats with a determined valor. Once, Iomedae ends all negative effects affecting you, unless they are from an artifact, deity, or similarly powerful source; she also restores all lost Hit Points and replenishes your spells, Focus Points, and other daily resources.\n**Major Boon**: Iomedae imbues your blade with great power. Longswords you wield gain the axiomatic, holy, and major striking runes while you hold them. These property runes count toward the number of runes you can have on your weapon, and if this would cause your weapon to exceed its limit, choose which ones to keep each day when you prepare. You gain a +2 status bonus to attack rolls with longswords.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Your blade and armor have dulled like lead. Your weapons, armor, and shields have half their usual Hit Points and Break Threshold.\n**Moderate Curse**: Tactical advantages never seem to work the way you planned. You can't receive a circumstance bonus to your attack rolls, and enemies don't take any circumstance penalties to their AC against your attacks.\n**Major Curse**: All blades reject your wicked heart. Any weapon you wield automatically becomes broken after you Strike with it. This curse can't break artifacts or similarly powerful weapons.",

He avoids bestowing misfortune as punishment, preferring to do so only to give an individual a challenging obstacle to overcome to help them progress in their quest for self-perfection.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Irori grants you great insight and knowledge. Once, when you roll a failure at a check to Recall Knowledge, you get a critical success instead. Furthermore, the check loses the secret trait, so you know for sure that the result was a critical success. Irori typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential check to Recall Knowledge.\n**Moderate Boon**: Your body rebuilds after adversity, becoming stronger. You can cast wholeness of body as an occult ki spell. If you didn't have one already, you gain a focus pool with 1 Focus Point and are trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs (the sidebar on the monk class page has full information on what happens when you gain your first ki spell).\n**Major Boon**: You can temporarily ascend to a greater form. You can cast 8th-level righteous might once per day as an occult innate spell. When you do, your form appears unremarkable, rather than clad in powerful armaments.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Irori challenges you to seek another path, rather than treat every problem as a nail just because you have a hammer. If you select a check for which you have a higher bonus when another method would have been more appropriate for the situation, such as using Deception to lie through life because it's your highest modifier, even if it would be better to reach a compromise through Diplomacy, you must roll twice and take the lower result.\n**Moderate Curse**: Irori challenges you to adapt to adversity in order to perfect yourself. You become weighed down as if under heavy weights, becoming clumsy 2 and encumbered until you accomplish a challenging task of Irori's choosing.\n**Major Curse**: Irori makes all living creatures forget your existence. This can be further compounded by raising Irori's ire, resulting in your name being obliterated from all written records. In both cases, memories and writings rearrange themselves to omit you smoothly, rather than leaving obvious gaps.",

The Mother of Monsters readily accepts mortals into her fold and has made it her goal to twist mortal life toward her abhorrent ideals. Her intervention is widely known to inflict corruptions and terrible nightmares. Ostracized individuals who share her ideals will find this intervention a boon, while others treat similar events as horrible curses.\n\n**Edicts** bring power to outcasts and the downtrodden, indoctrinate children in Lamashtu's teachings, make the beautiful monstrous, reveal the corruption and flaws in all things\n**Anathema** attempt to treat a mental illness or deformity, provide succor to Lamashtu's enemies\n**Areas of Concern** aberrance, monsters, and nightmares\n**Follower Alignments** CE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Constitution or Strength\n**Divine Font** harm or heal\n**Divine Skill** Survival\n**Favored Weapon** falchion\n**Domains** family, might, nightmares, trickery\n**Alternate Domains** change\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: magic fang, 2nd: animal form, 4th: nightmare\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nLamashtu rewards kinship with monsters and brutal dominance in combat.

You gain either an unarmed Strike that deals 1d6 damage or one that deals 1d4 damage and has the finesse and agile traits. Whether the attack deals bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage depends on the mutation. If the unarmed Strike replaces a limb, you can still use the mutated limb for its original functions. Lamashtu chooses the form and function of your mutation.\n**Moderate Boon**: You spread Lamashtu's nightmares everywhere you go. You can cast confusion once per day as an divine innate spell.\n**Major Boon**: Lamashtu uses your body to birth a new monster, regardless of your gender. Once per day, you can spend 1 minute to birth a monster determined by the GM, which rips its way from your belly. The monster's level is up to your level and it does as it pleases, following Lamashtu's will, though it doesn't attack you unless you have lost her favor. You are drained 3 from the ordeal.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Horrid visions torment your mind, overlaying reality at inopportune times. You treat everything around you as if it was concealed.\n**Moderate Curse**: Lamashtu marks you as prey. Any creature with imprecise or better scent can smell you from 100  the usual range of their scent and can't shake the feeling that you smell like prey, so they might attack you even if they would normally avoid attacking creatures of your ancestry. This smell doesn't magically compel their action, and the scent of prey doesn't overcome a deeper bond such as that with an animal companion.\n**Major Curse**: Your dreams are an unending stream of nightmares. You need 16 hours of rest to try to get enough sleep to recover resources in daily preparation that normally require an 8-hour rest, and even then, you must succeed at a DC 15 flat check to do so, and you are still fatigued on a successful check.\n\n#### Feats Requiring Worship of Lamashtu...\nChosen of Lamashtu",

			"body": "To some, magic is a powerful weapon. To others, it's a malleable tool. And to a few, it's a source of purpose. With an understanding of spellcasting, creatures can cause fire to erupt from their hands, call otherworldly beings to aid them, bewitch the senses, and even bring the dead back to life. The ability to reshape reality to better suit one's needs and desires is a powerful call that most only dream of being able to answer, and few are ever able to truly master such might.\n\nOne such master was Nethys, who was revered as a god-king in ancient Osirion. Having sought to unlock all of the secrets and potential held within the planes and beyond, Nethys shattered his own mind from the sheer overload of knowledge to which he was exposed. Witnessing all of creation, the secrets of the universe, and the vast expanse of what has been seen and will be seen rent his mind in the same moment he elevated to the status of a god. Nethys gained unlimited power and the skill to utilize it, but at the cost of his core self and mental security. This resulted in a split soul, two sides warring within the same body. One seeks to destroy the world, to purge it through fire and ruin, and to conquer all that exists. The other attempts to protect the world, to elevate and educate, and to release it from its limits.\n\n**Edicts** seek out magical power and use it\n**Anathema** pursue mundane paths over magical ones\n**Areas of Concern** magic\n**Follower Alignments** NG, LN, N, CN, NE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Wisdom or Intelligence\n**Divine Font** harm or heal\n**Divine Skill** Arcana\n**Favored Weapon** staff\n**Domains** destruction, knowledge, magic, protection\n**Alternate Domains** glyph\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: magic missile, 2nd: magic mouth, 3rd: levitate, 4th: blink, 5th: prying eye, 6th: wall of force, 7th: warp mind, 8th: maze, 9th: disjunction\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nNethys is often impartial to his followers and their wishes, so it is rare to gain a heightened favor from the god of magic. However, blatant disregard and stifling of magic will certainly earn his ire.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Nethys casts a powerful spell to help you in a pinch. Once, Nethys casts a spell 1 level higher than the highest-level spell you can cast. If you can't cast spells, Nethys casts a 1st-level spell to help you.\n**Moderate Boon**: Nethys grants you insight into the secrets of magic. Add one spell from a different tradition of magic to your spell list. You still must learn it or add it to your repertoire normally.\n**Major Boon**: You are granted supreme magical knowledge and mastery. If you are a prepared spellcaster, you can switch one of your prepared spells for another spell you could have prepared in that slot; if you are a spontaneous spellcaster, you can switch one of the spells in your spell repertoire for another spell you could have chosen for your repertoire instead. In either case, you make this switch by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. (If you are neither a prepared nor a spontaneous spellcaster, Nethys won't grant you his major boon.)\n\n**Minor Curse**: The secrets of magic become mentally taxing. You are permanently stupefied 1.\n**Moderate Curse**: Your magic wars against itself like Nethys's dueling halves. Whenever you cast a spell, attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, if your spell was harmful, you instead cast a beneficial spell of the same level on your intended targets, and if it was beneficial, you instead cast a harmful spell of the same level on your intended targets. If the spell benefited some targets and harmed others, you cast a spell of the same level that switches who benefited (for instance, changing a heal spell that harmed undead and healed the living to a harm spell that healed undead and harmed the living). You still lose the spell slot for the spell you were trying to cast.\n**Major Curse**: Nethys severs your connection to magic.

You are immune to divination effects and attempts to magically alter your memory, unless you choose to be affected or those effects come from a deity, artifact, or similarly powerful source. You also can never be tricked or forced by mundane means into uttering a secret you wish to keep.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Norgorber allows thieves to get the better of you.

Once each day when you awake from rest, roll 1d4. On a 1, you forget the events of the previous day forever. On a 2, you temporarily experience complete retrograde amnesia for that day, unable to recall information from the past, including who you are. On a 3, you temporarily forget a single important subject for that day (Norgorber tends to intentionally chooses a memory to cause distress, such as making you forget your spouse on your anniversary).

The GM secretly chooses a fate Pharasma knows you must fulfill. Until you fulfill this fate, any time you would die, a grave but nonfatal misfortune instead befalls you. You take at least a full day to recuperate and you potentially face permanent consequences, but you don't die. If you would have died even once without this boon, once your fate is complete, you let out a final sigh and then die peacefully.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Horrifying or enticing visions of your final judgment distract you from the task at hand. You take a -2 status penalty to initiative rolls.\n**Moderate Curse**: Fate turns against you and reveals dire portents. Divinations such as augury cast by you or that involve you always suggest woe. Once per day after you attempt a check, the GM can make the result of the roll a natural 1.\n**Major Curse**: Pharasma wills the end of your life and your lineage. You become unable to have children (or otherwise procreate by any means, including create spawn abilities) and are permanently doomed 2.",

			"body": "Rovagug has no single holy scripture. He has little use for one, for his sole commandment is to destroy, and his followers need no instruction in how to accomplish that. The figurative and literal monsters who worship Rovagug share their myths and legends in secret shrines and hidden caves, calling him the Rough Beast, the Imprisoned King, the Tide of Fangs, the Unmaker, and the Worldbreaker. They tell each other that each life they snuff out, each piece of art they destroy, each work of labor they bring tumbling down puts a crack in the prison that holds their god. Each of their little efforts of destruction adds up and will one day free him, setting him loose to bring about the end of all things.\n\n**Edicts** destroy all things, free Rovagug from his prison\n**Anathema** create something new, let material ties restrain you, torture a victim or otherwise delay its destruction\n**Areas of Concern** destruction, disaster, and wrath\n**Follower Alignments** NE, CE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Strength or Constitution\n**Divine Font** harm\n**Divine Skill** Athletics\n**Favored Weapon** greataxe\n**Domains** air, destruction, earth, zeal\n**Alternate Domains** swarm, void\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: burning hands, 2nd: enlarge, 6th: disintegrate\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nRovagug's imprisonment means he can almost never intercede on Golarion, but some places lead far enough into the earth that the god's profane influence can leak through. He is as likely to curse those who draw his attention as he is to reward them, though great enough acts of violence and destruction may earn his favor.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Your attack becomes more destructive. Once, one of your failed or successful attacks becomes a critical hit, and your weapon or unarmed attack gains the deadly d12 trait for this attack, replacing any deadly trait it already had. Rovagug typically grants this boon when the critical hit could destroy something precious or significant.\n**Moderate Boon**: You can devour all. You mouth grows into a horrible circular, insectile maw of needle-like teeth. You gain a bite unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage. Additionally, you can stomach eating anything you can fit down your throat-even rocks or small objects. You gain a +4 status bonus to saves resulting from eating something, such as diseases, poisons, or other effects of the ingested object. This doesn't allow you to digest magic items that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to destroy, such as cursed items or artifacts.\n**Major Boon**: You can crack the surface of Golarion, accelerating the release of the Rough Beast. You gain the Quaking Stomp barbarian feat.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Whenever you are imprisoned, you thrash and shake as your mind fills with desperation. Any time you are restrained or otherwise imprisoned (such as being sent to jail), you are also clumsy 2 and stupefied 2.\n**Moderate Curse**: Your destructive rage seeks to remain unbound. Any armor you wear automatically becomes broken. Other items in your possession occasionally become broken over time.\n**Major Curse**: You are useful only as a beacon of destruction. You are permanently confused, rampaging against anything and everything in your sight, and you deal an additional 18 damage with your unarmed and weapon Strikes.",

Most people thank her for her kind work to channel the sun's power for everyone's safety and livelihood, and thank her clergy for granting her healing power to all who need it. Mortals look to the Dawnflower as an example of boundless love, exquisite kindness, and true patience. They pray to her to heal the sick, lift up the downtrodden, and illuminate darkness of circumstance as well as darkness of spirit. Her followers aspire to emulate her through generosity, nurturing, truthfulness, and selfless courage.

She typically curses those who betray her mercy.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Your healing hands are blessed with a warm flame. Once, when you heal another creature, instead of healing it for the normal amount, you heal the creature to full Hit Points, no matter how much damage it has taken. Sarenrae typically grants this boon in extremely consequential circumstances.\n**Moderate Boon**: Your blade burns the irredeemable. Your attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage that ignores fire resistance.\n**Major Boon**: You are a voice of peace and rehabilitation. When you roll a success at a check to Request something, you get a critical success instead. In addition, all creatures other than fiends, undead, and mindless creatures allow you one chance to speak your piece and make requests before entering combat. If you or an ally ever use the time from the request to gain an advantage in an ensuing combat (for example, by casting preparatory spells, positioning for combat, or waiting out your opponent's preparatory spells), Sarenrae immediately revokes this boon, or possibly curses your ally.\n\n**Minor Curse**: The sun burns you for your transgression. You receive a sunburn that causes you to become permanently clumsy 1.\n**Moderate Curse**: The sun shines its light on everything you say. You become unable to tell lies, and if you attempt to do so, you instead compulsively blurt out the truth on the matter in question. You are still able to withhold information or lie by omission.\n**Major Curse**: Sarenrae restricts your ability to harm others. All attacks you make, spells you cast, and other sources of damage you deal are nonlethal except against fiends and undead, and you can't ever make them lethal. You deal minimum damage except against fiends and undead. All creatures except fiends and undead gain a +4 status bonus to their AC and saving throws against your attacks and other effects.",

Even the crudest artistic awakenings are worthy of praise in the goddess's eyes, as they represent an individual's expression of life's trials and triumphs. She believes every creature is worthy of love and capable of creating art in their own way. Shelyn's religion does not require chastity, fidelity, or a particular relationship structure, as the passion of early romance is a facet of love just as important and valid as the comfortable trust between a long-married couple. However, she does make the distinction between courtship and pure carnal desire, and she prefers that trysts blossom into more meaningful relationships along the way.\n\n**Edicts** be peaceful, choose and perfect an art, lead by example, see the beauty in all things\n**Anathema** destroy art or allow it to be destroyed, unless saving a life or pursuing greater art; refuse to accept surrender\n**Areas of Concern** art, beauty, love, and music\n**Follower Alignments** LG, NG, CG\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Wisdom or Charisma\n**Divine Font** heal\n**Divine Skill** Crafting or Performance\n**Favored Weapon** glaive\n**Domains** creation, family, passion, protection\n**Alternate Domains** repose\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: color spray, 3rd: enthrall, 4th: creation\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nWhen creatures perform pleasing acts, such as spreading beauty, or displeasing actions, such as betraying loved ones, Shelyn may respond accordingly.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Once, when you roll a failure on a Diplomacy check, you get a critical success instead. Shelyn typically grants this boon only when the Diplomacy check would serve to increase love or offer a chance of redemption.\n**Moderate Boon**: You are inspired to create great works and become a virtuoso at all arts. You gain the Specialty Crafting feat and the Virtuoso Performer feat in all categories of Crafting and Performance.\n**Major Boon**: Your inner beauty and love surround you in an aura. As long as you bear them no ill will, all creatures other than fiends, undead, and mindless creatures start with an attitude of friendly toward you, unless they would have been helpful instead. This doesn't mean they are willing to change their life or plans for you, and this boon does not prevent their attitudes from worsening if you try to thwart them. This effect doesn't work against deities and similarly powerful creatures. Additionally, the love you share with your friends inspires them. You and your allies gain a +3 status bonus to saving throws and skill checks as long as you can see each other.\n\n**Minor Curse**: You heart churns with remorse. Each day, you are sickened 1 as a specific misdeed plays out in your mind over and over in guilt. You can't remove this condition, though it abates enough for you to quickly eat and drink when necessary. If you make amends or otherwise earnestly pursue redemption for the misdeed, the sickened condition fades completely that day.\n**Moderate Curse**: Others subconsciously recognize your past betrayals. Whenever you attempt a Diplomacy check and roll a failure, you get a critical failure instead, and if you roll a critical success, you get a success instead.\n**Major Curse**: Those who spread misery via false love face Shelyn's greatest curse. You lose the ability to distinguish any living being from another through appearance, voice, scent, or similar sensory means. You can make out physical size (so you wouldn't mistake an ant for a horse), but nothing further. If you were merely shallow, every creature you see has generic, bland features, but if your deeds were vile, you see only the faces of those you have wronged.",

While the other dwarven gods represent specific areas of dwarven life and culture, thus forming an expansive and comprehensive dwarven pantheon, Torag's areas of concern are those most central to dwarven society. In his own family, Torag models the values of community and protection that have cemented deep-rooted relationships among dwarven clans. His focus on strategy and tactical acumen centers on protection, reflected in dwarves' impenetrable fortresses and conservative military tactics, including their willingness to use offensive maneuvers as a form of defense. He also represents the forge: the creation of fine works from raw materials, practice and mastery of a craft, and pride in one's work. His purview extends even to those activities that feed the forge and dwarven artisanship, such as mining the earth for raw ore and gemstones. Torag's oversight over these core concepts has secured his place at the head of the dwarven pantheon for ages. It was Torag who sent the dwarves on their legendary Quest for Sky during the Age of Darkness, and his worship was long-established even then. Indeed, among dwarves, Torag is often called the Father of Creation.\n\n**Edicts** be honorable and forthright, keep your word, respect the forge, serve your people\n**Anathema** tell lies or cheat someone, intentionally create inferior works, show mercy to the enemies of your people\n**Areas of Concern** forge, protection, and strategy\n**Follower Alignments** LG, LN\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Constitution or Wisdom\n**Divine Font** heal\n**Divine Skill** Crafting\n**Favored Weapon** warhammer\n**Domains** creation, earth, family, protection\n**Alternate Domains** duty\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: mindlink, 3rd: earthbind, 4th: creation\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nTorag makes his pleasure or displeasure known through unsubtle signs.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Torag repairs your equipment so you may continue your vigil. Once, a shield, weapon, or other item you hold or are wearing recovers all of its Hit Points. The item's Hardness doubles for 1 minute. Torag can grant this boon just as the item would have been destroyed, preventing the item's destruction. Occasionally, he grants this boon to restore an item important to dwarven history that has already been fully destroyed.\n**Moderate Boon**: You are counted as family among Torag and his followers. You gain the effects of a single dwarf ancestry feat of Torag's choice, even if you are not a dwarf, as long as you maintain Torag's blessing.\n**Major Boon**: Standing watch or guarding a location counts as resting for you, preventing you from being fatigued due to lack of rest as long as you stand watch for at least 6 hours a day. You can recover your Focus Points (if you have them) by standing guard in addition to any other options you have available. When on guard, you gain a +4 status bonus to Perception to notice ambushes and other dangers approaching. As long as you are holding a shield, you are always Defending during exploration without needing to move at half your travel speed, and you can perform another exploration activity as well. While you are using a shield, its Hardness increases by 5.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Shoddy artisanship makes itself known. Whenever an item you're using takes damage, it is broken.\n**Moderate Curse**: You must prove your skills at a craft by providing your own equipment. You gain item bonuses only from items you make yourself.\n**Major Curse**: You are forever cast out from your home. Members of your community have their attitudes towards you shift two steps worse, meaning those who used to be helpful are now indifferent, those who were friendly are now unfriendly, and all others are now hostile. This doesn't necessarily result in violence, but hostile community members generally seek your permanent exile.",

If you dine on the flesh and blood of sapient creatures, you need to eat only the normal amount of such meals and your hunger abates.\n**Moderate Curse**: Urgathoa cuts you off from positive energy without granting you the blessing of undeath. You are harmed by positive effects and don't recover Hit Points from them, as if you were an undead or had negative healing, but you are still harmed by negative effects as normal.\n**Major Curse**: Urgathoa teaches you that pointless lives in slavery to death and morality are bound to end in tragedy. You develop an incurable wasting disease that leaves you clumsy 2, enfeebled 2, and unable to move except by Crawling. This disease never progresses further to kill you, but it passes to your friends and loved ones merely by sight, wasting them away unto death before your eyes and causing them to rise as undead to haunt you.",

Yet a divine argument between him and his sister Shelyn resulted in the god departing for parts unknown. Zon-Kuthon traveled beyond the edges of the multiverse and stared into the face of the incomprehensible things that dwell there. No one knows what he found in that place, but he returned-changed, but claiming to be strengthened by what he had endured.

Once, for 1 minute, whenever you take slashing, piercing, or bleed damage, chains rip forth from your body, affecting creatures in a line from your position in the direction of the attack (or in the direction of your choice for bleed damage or if you deal the damage yourself) with the effect of a grim tendrils spell whose level is equal to half your level rounded up, and whose DC is your highest spell DC (or 10 + your level + your Wisdom modifier if you have no spell DC).\n**Moderate Boon**: Each morning, during your daily preparations, scars gather into words on your flesh. The scars function as a scroll of a divine spell of Zon- Kuthon's choosing. After you use the scroll or receive magical healing, the boon fades for the day, though some or all of the scars might remain as a reminder.\n**Major Boon**: Shadows are deeper around you. Darkvision and greater darkvision cannot penetrate darkness within 60 feet of you, but you can see through it normally.\n\n**Minor Curse**: You are surrounded by spectral chains that cause you to always be encumbered and that have the same effects as armor with the noisy trait.\n**Moderate Curse**: You share the pain of others, and even minor wounds bring you incredible pain. Whenever you see (or otherwise sense) a creature take damage, you take 1d6 mental damage. Whenever you take damage any other way than from the first part of this curse, you take 1d6 mental damage from increased pain and are sickened 1. Mental damage from this curse ignores any resistance you have to mental damage.\n**Major Curse**: Zon-Kuthon steals away your joy, leaving you with only pain. You lose that which you cherish the most forever, and lose the ability to feel joy. You can't gain benefits from emotion effects based on positive emotions. If Zon-Kuthon feels you are ready to renounce, destroy, mutilate, or torture that which you once cherished most, he might return it to you to allow you to do so.",
