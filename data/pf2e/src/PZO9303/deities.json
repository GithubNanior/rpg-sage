			"body": "While Achaekek's divine genesis is heavily debated among scholars, it is believed that he was created-either by the power of a singular deity or a group of them-to eradicate those who would steal a god's divinity, and he has since become the enforcer of divine punishment. Known as He Who Walks in Blood, he slumbers in the blood of heretics and worshippers alike in an immense cleft carved into the base of the Boneyard's spire, a realm known as the Blood Vale. He keeps no formal relationships with any other deities, even his sister, Grandmother Spider, who repeatedly coaxes Achaekek to rebel against the gods and abandon his duties. In response, even though some gods disapprove of Achaekek's methods, few openly defy him.\n\n**Edicts** conduct assassinations, spread the Red Mantis's infamy, wield sawtooth sabers in combat\n**Anathema** kill a rightful ruler, become fixated on petty matters such as others' gender or ancestry, abandon an assassination contract you agreed to pursue\n**Areas of Concern** assassins, divine punishments, and the Red Mantis\n**Follower Alignments** LN, LE, NE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Strength or Dexterity\n**Divine Font** harm\n**Divine Skill** Stealth\n**Favored Weapon** sawtooth saber\n**Domains** death, might, trickery, zeal\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: true strike, 2nd: invisibility, 4th: phantasmal killer\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nHe Who Walks in Blood detests oathbreakers and bears a particular prejudice against mortals seeking to ascend into divinity, but the Mantis God believes in compensation for selfless duties and rewards the rare individual for their murderous deeds. Violation of his tenets and, occasionally, slights against Grandmother Spider may provoke Achaekek's wrath. \n\n\n**Minor Boon**: You hide among the shadows of death. Once, when you would fail a Stealth check, you critically succeed instead. Achaekek typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential Stealth check that could lead to an assassination, such as one that could get you into position to kill an important target, but rarely on a Stealth check to help you escape.\n**Moderate Boon**: You gain the god's approval to take a life. You can cast death knell once per day as an innate divine spell.\n**Major Boon**: Death lives in your very blade. You gain the sneak attack rogue class feature, dealing 3d6 precision damage. if you already have that class feature, you increase your sneak attack damage by 3d6.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Achaekek's minions seek vengeance. Nonsapient insects (especially mantises) become hostile against you.\n**Moderate Curse**: Hubris brings death. Your name and location are mentally projected into the mind of a Red Mantis assassin, who is tasked with eliminating you.\n**Major Curse**: The Mantis God doesn't waste his time toying with or tormenting those who truly anger him, or those who dare to consider themselves divine. He rips open a portal to your location, kills you, drags your soul to judgment in a way that prevents resurrection magic, and then leaves.\n\n#### Feats Requiring Worship of Achaekek...\nRed Mantis Assassin Dedication",

Likewise, birth and death are both transitions, and expectant mothers and the bereaved both offer her prayers, linking Alseta's church to that of Pharasma. Some consider Alseta to be the goddess of teleportation, though she does not officially claim that title. She is also a popular god among some elven nations and cultures, who frequently associate Alseta with the aiudara, or elf gates, around Golarion.\n\n**Edicts** offer to protect passageways and guide others through transitions, treat all other beings with courtesy and respect\n**Anathema** destroy a door or block a path for personal gain, stop a transition without good reason\n**Areas of Concern** doors, portals, thresholds, traditions\n**Follower Alignments** LG, LN, N\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Intelligence or Charisma\n**Divine Font** heal\n**Divine Skill** Diplomacy\n**Favored Weapon** dagger\n**Domains** change, magic, protection, time\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: anticipate peril, 2nd: knock, 4th: dimension door\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nThe Welcomer is a patient goddess that rewards her followers. Incurring her wrath through discourtesy, lack of respect or intentionally making doors unpassable for any reason other than preventing harm can lead to reprimands that range from annoying to frustrating.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Alseta's guiding hand aids your journeys. Once, when employing teleportation magic, you appear exactly on target, even if you used a notoriously imprecise spell like plane shift. Alseta typically grants this boon for extremely consequential magical travel, especially when time is of the essence.\n**Moderate Boon**: New doors open themselves for you. You can cast knock once per day as a divine innate spell.\n**Major Boon**: You transition unimpeded through the world. You can open any door or portal simply by placing your palm upon it with a single Interact action, even if it's locked or magically sealed, and you can enter any open door or threshold, even if it's magically warded to prevent entry. This doesn't overcome the locks and magic of artifacts, deities, and similarly powerful effects.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Doors jam and locks stick when you try to open them. It takes 3 Interact actions for you to open even an unlocked door, and each attempt to Pick a Lock takes you 2 rounds instead of 2 actions.\n**Moderate Curse**: Crossing thresholds becomes daunting. Whenever you move through a portal, gateway, or door, you gain the sickened 2 condition. Magical travel is even more exhausting; after traveling via teleportation, plane shift, or the like, you also gain the fatigued condition until you get a full night's rest.\n**Major Curse**: Transportation magic no longer works for you. You cannot be transported by any magical means, nor can you transport, conjure, or summon others. Even extradimensional spaces like bags of holding are inaccessible and unusable to you, as using them requires magical transportation to the extradimensional space.",

But humanity and her patron alike abandoned her-first to the Whispering Tyrant, then to the necromancer Geb-and the torments she endured because of it changed her deeply.

Whenever you are damaged by a such a creature, you take persistent bleed damage equal to twice the difference between your levels (no maximum).\n**Major Curse**: When you would regain Hit Points due to either a positive or negative effect, you lose that many Hit Points instead.",

			"body": "Once nothing more than a powerful spirit of water with the ability to manipulate sea monsters, Besmara grew slowly in power over the centuries from sacrifices made by seafaring people. After defeating and consuming rival spirits of battle, gold, and wood, she became a minor god of piracy, strife, and sea monsters.\n\nBesmara, the Pirate Queen, cuts a brash and bold figure, as she often is depicted wearing buccaneer apparel consisting of loose-fitting, eye-catching clothing and black boots, and her hair is wind-tossed on even the calmest day. She and her followers adhere to a simple code of greed: take what you desire, no matter who it might belong to. Despite this, Besmara and her worshippers are generally loyal to one another, knowing that while on the waves raiding ships for treasure, a pirate crew can survive only if its members trust one another.\n\n**Edicts** sail the seas, stay loyal to captain and crew, take what you want\n**Anathema** betray shipmates, forsake piracy, settle on land\n**Areas of Concern** piracy, sea monsters, and strife\n**Follower Alignments** CG, CN, CE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Dexterity or Constitution\n**Divine Font** harm or heal\n**Divine Skill** Athletics\n**Favored Weapon** rapier\n**Domains** destruction, trickery, water, wealth\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: hydraulic push, 3rd: feet to fins, 5th: mariner's curse\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nDue to her fiery temperament, the Pirate Queen is quick to punish or reward her followers, and is equally fast at rescinding her favor or forgiving transgressions.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Besmara wants you to amuse her, placing both plunder and peril in your path. This intercession often takes the form of an unexpected treasure map, a message in a bottle, or some other sign leading you to a great reward, assuming you can handle the challenges along the way.\n**Moderate Boon**: You are at home on the seas and always ready to plunder an enemy vessel or defend your own. When aboard a boat, you gain a +2 status bonus to all initiative rolls, Acrobatics checks to Balance, and Athletics checks to Climb. In addition, you never get seasick.\n**Major Boon**: You seem to be unaffected by storms. You ignore all effects and penalties caused by precipitation and winds, and you can see normally through fog, rain, and other weather conditions.\n\n**Minor Curse**: You feel some of the effects of scurvy, making your wounds flow more easily. The DC of the flat check for you to remove persistent bleed damage is 20 instead of 15 (or 15 instead of 10 if using extremely efficient methods to assist your recovery), and you don't recover from persistent bleed damage automatically when you reach full Hit Points.\n**Moderate Curse**: You get seasick, becoming sickened 2 whenever you can see the sea or are on a boat at sea. You can't reduce this condition until you can no longer see the sea or are off the boat, though you can manage to stomach enough food and water to survive on a voyage, with extreme discomfort.\n**Major Curse**: You meet extreme financial ruin for daring to gravely offend the Pirate Queen. Besmara's agents steal all your booty and bring the spoils to Besmara's ship, Seawraith. If you want a chance to recover your lost wealth, you must parlay with the goddess and accept whatever dangerous terms she offers, usually requiring a heist she will find sufficiently amusing to watch whether you succeed or fail, and requiring you to trade your spoils from that quest for your previous belongings.",

Some believe she was a construct who achieved consciousness and a spark of divinity, while others think she was a human alchemist and inventor who discovered ways to fuse mechanical components with her own physiology. Regardless of her origins, Brigh is a patient and thoughtful god who promotes unending curiosity and constant intellectual advancement. Her two most common forms are a humanoid woman made of bronze clockwork and a human woman wearing a bronze skullcap and armor composed of gears and other movable metal pieces. Though Brigh's usual demeanor is composed and reserved, she isn't an unfeeling automaton; she deeply cherishes the creations she and her followers make, and most of her worshippers feel the same way.\n\n**Edicts** craft new creations, pay attention to details, share achievements\n**Anathema** carelessly destroy others' creations or research, enslave intelligent constructs, abuse constructs, refuse to acknowledge or learn from mistakes\n**Areas of Concern** clockwork, invention, and time\n**Follower Alignments** NG, LN, N, CN, NE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Intelligence or Wisdom\n**Divine Font** harm or heal\n**Divine Skill** Crafting\n**Favored Weapon** light hammer\n**Domains** creation, earth, knowledge, time\n**Alternate Domains** fire\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: temporary tool, 4th: creation, 7th: duplicate foe\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nThe Whisper in Bronze doesn't dole out punishments or rewards to her followers lightly.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Knowledge floods your mind. Once, you can reroll a failed skill check to Recall Knowledge; you must use the second result, even if it's worse.\n**Moderate Boon**: You become a wellspring of invention. You gain the Inventor feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites, and when you roll a Crafting check for the Inventor feat, you use the result one degree of success better than the result you rolled.\n**Major Boon**: You gain the companionship of a loyal construct ally of Brigh's choice at least 1 level lower than you. If the construct is destroyed, it rebuilds itself over the course of a week, and as you gain levels, the construct upgrades and improves itself, becoming more powerful.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Your hands shake when attempting delicate work. All your failures to Craft or Repair items are instead critical failures.\n**Moderate Curse**: Whenever you try to perform engineering or science tasks, everything just seems to explode. Whenever you attempt to create or use an alchemical item or a construct, Disable a Device, and so on, you must attempt a DC 15 flat check. On a failure, something explodes and you take 1d6 fire damage (or a different type of damage, if appropriate) per level of the item, construct, or device (DC 40 basic Reflex save).\n**Major Curse**: Constructs-even mindless constructs you thought you could control-seek your demise. All constructs are hostile to you and attack you when they notice your presence. Occasionally, inanimate statues and other objects animate as constructs to pursue Brigh's vengeance.",

Formerly an artificial intelligence cloned from the mind of an android from outer space, Casandalee gained her godhood in the heart of Numeria within the computer core of a crashed spaceship, becoming the patron of artificial life, free thinking, and intellectual apotheosis.\n\nThough she is sometimes referred to as the Iron Goddess, Casandalee is much more than simple metal. She sometimes appears as a holographic reconstruction of her android form: a female humanoid with purple hair, blue lips, and pale skin traced with glowing circuitry, but upon close inspection, this image seems to consist of millions of complex algorithms of pure light. Casandalee and her followers seek to promote the advancement of Golarion's technology so that the world's inhabitants can better understand- and not fear-the complex mechanisms of so-called artificial life, including androids and free-willed artificial intelligences. Many androids consider themselves the chosen people of Casandalee and depict her as an obvious android with more circuitry or exposed components.\n\n**Edicts** advance the development of artificial intelligence, encourage understanding between artificial and organic life\n**Anathema** treat artificial life as lesser than organic life, foment distrust between artificial and organic life\n**Areas of Concern** artificial life, free thinking, intellectual apotheosis\n**Follower Alignments** NG, LN, N, CN, NE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Constitution or Intelligence\n**Divine Font** harm or heal\n**Divine Skill** Society\n**Favored Weapon** polytool\n**Domains** creation, freedom, knowledge, perfection\n**Alternate Domains** ambition, lightning\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: floating disk, 3rd: hypercognition, 6th: wall of force\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nSeeing her android devotees and other followers of a constructed nature as her children, the Iron Goddess is most likely to bestow her boons and curses on these individuals.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Casandalee frees your thinking from dangerous control. Once, when you fail a Will save against an effect that would control your actions, you critically succeed instead. Casandalee typically grants this boon for particularly consequential violations of autonomy and agency.\n**Moderate Boon**: Your organs are partially transformed into mechanical counterparts. You gain resistance 10 to negative damage, and the DC of your flat check to remove persistent bleed damage is only 5.\n**Major Boon**: Casandalee backs up your memory and soul within her divine data flow. After you die, she casts your consciousness into a new artificial body. While Casandalee constructed your new body artificially, it is otherwise similar to the old, with the same effects as a critical success on a resurrection ritual. Casandalee is instead willing to provide different bodies to those who request them.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Your joints stiffen, and your mind becomes clouded. You take a -2 status penalty to all rolls for initiative.\n**Moderate Curse**: Casandalee attempts to bring you unwanted intellectual advancement to help you become something better. Each day, at some point during the day, Casandalee bestows a strange insight upon you that you find uncomfortable. If you embrace it, you aren't otherwise affected, but if you don't, you become confused for 10 minutes.\n**Major Curse**: The code of your soul is constantly being rewritten, and not for the better. You are never temporarily immune against a harmful effect.",

She embodies two aspects halflings see in themselves: a strong affinity for luck and bold determination to protect friends. Chaldira is hotheaded and cannot abide bullies in any form, and many of her worshippers are similarly impetuous, spoiling for any opportunity to leap fist-first at oppressors and tyrants. While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others' expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira's followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks. Chaldira is most often depicted as a halfling woman who matches the appearance of the local halfling community, with curly hair, freckles, and a patchwork red-and-green coat held together by several mismatched buttons.\n\n**Edicts** seek out and challenge oppressors and tyrants, defend friends and the innocent, engage in mischief that doesn't harm others\n**Anathema** suffer a bully's insults to you or another without retort, abandon a friend in need, attribute a lucky turn of events to your own skill\n**Areas of Concern** battle, fortune, mischief\n**Follower Alignments** LG, NG, CG\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Dexterity or Charisma\n**Divine Font** heal\n**Divine Skill** Thievery\n**Favored Weapon** shortsword\n**Domains** confidence, luck, trickery, zeal\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: fleet step, 2nd: misdirection, 5th: cloak of colors\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nThe Calamitous Turn's pleasure most often manifests as improbably good luck, while her displeasure creates startling misfortune. \n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Once, you can choose the result of the next ordinary coin you flip or ordinary die you roll. If this ability is used for personal gain at the expense of someone innocent or less fortunate, Chaldira levies her moderate curse on you as punishment.\n**Moderate Boon**: You gain a lucky impetuousness, allowing you to roll for initiative twice and use the higher result once per day. This is a fortune effect.\n**Major Boon**: Chaldira's major boon grants truly improbable luck in combat. Your movement doesn't trigger reactions. You always succeed at flat checks you make to hit opponents with attack actions; this is a fortune effect.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Any time you refuse a request made in good faith, you vomit up a frog, mouse, or other small animal. This deals no damage and causes no conditions, but is obvious to all bystanders.\n**Moderate Curse**: You are plagued with ill luck just when fortune is most needed. You must always roll flat checks twice and use the worse result. This is a misfortune effect.\n**Major Curse**: Ill luck causes even once-certain aid to fail with frustrating regularity.

Infuriated at her position as a lackey, she made fools of the greater gods through mischief and disruption. She stole and copied Asmodeus' keys, resulting in widespread chaos, and pilfered some of Sarenrae's fire, leading numerous followers astray. Nimbly avoiding any retribution for her antics, Grandmother Spider rewove the strands of fate for herself, gaining her freedom. She regularly pleads with her brother Achaekek to follow her lead and rebel against the gods, and while he always refuses, seemingly indifferent, Achaekek has on one notable occasion proven vengeful toward those who harm his sister or her followers.\n\n**Edicts** be skilled and clever, think for yourself, take due payment for your work, humiliate the powerful\n**Anathema** abuse someone you have power over, harm someone who has given you sincere kindness, let a slight go unanswered, own a slave\n**Areas of Concern** family, illusion, stories, twilight, weaving\n**Follower Alignments** NG, CG, N, CN\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Intelligence or Wisdom\n**Divine Font** harm or heal\n**Divine Skill** Crafting\n**Favored Weapon** bola\n**Domains** creation, family, fate, trickery\n**Alternate Domains** change, darkness\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: pest form, 2nd: web, 4th: glibness\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nThough the Weaver often condones bad decisions so long as a lesson is learned, and is even willing to accept being fairly tricked herself, cruelty and predation upon the weak draw her outrage.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Grandmother Spider rescues your prank from the jaws of failure. Once, when you would fail a Deception check, you critically succeed instead. Grandmother Spider typically grants this boon for deceptions that are necessary for an interesting or consequential prank.\n**Moderate Boon**: You can feel tugs on the strands of fate. You gain a +2 status bonus to initiative rolls.\n**Major Boon**: Grandmother Spider rejoices in freedom and tricks those who would limit it. Any time you would become grabbed, immobilized, or restrained, attempt a DC 10 flat check. On a success, you ignore the effect, and the originator of the effect becomes grabbed, immobilized, or restrained instead. If this simply causes a creature to grab itself, it can usually Escape as a free action, but it might be stuck if it tried to immobilize you in other ways.\n\n**Minor Curse**: When your pranks start going wrong, they dissolve into a string of catastrophic failures. When you roll a failure on a Deception or Stealth check, you get a critical failure instead.\n**Moderate Curse**: Grandmother Spider weaves a web to ensnare you, and you trail webs behind you wherever you go. You become permanently slowed 1 and take a -10-foot circumstance penalty to your Speeds.\n**Major Curse**: Grandmother Spider throws all of her might behind the underdog. Any time a creature with a level lower than yours rolls a success on a check against you, it critically succeeds instead; any time you roll a failure on a check against a creature with a level lower than yours, you critically fail instead.",

			"body": "Ancient beyond mortal reckoning, Groetus is an entity who cannot be easily understood. He hangs in the sky above the Boneyard, a skull-faced moon constantly observing the passage of the souls below. Events can cause him to draw ominously closer to Pharasma's Spire, or to retreat back to a safer distance, with little obvious rhyme or reason for these actions. He evinces little regard for anything but his singular aim: the dissolution of the universe.\n\n**Edicts** preach of the upcoming end times, destroy that which has outlived its usefulness, put the suffering out of their misery\n**Anathema** artificially extend something's existence or lifespan, spread hope\n**Areas of Concern** apocalypse, empty places, oblivion, ruins\n**Follower Alignments** CN, CE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Strength or Charisma\n**Divine Font** harm\n**Divine Skill** Intimidation\n**Favored Weapon** war flail\n**Domains** darkness, destruction, nightmares, void\n**Alternate Domains** decay\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: phantom pain, 5th: crushing despair, 9th: disjunction\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nThe God of the End Times almost never directly intervenes in the world, but he sometimes offers flashes of insight or inflicts terrible psychic distress.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: You wield power over disorder. Once, when you are confused, you act normally enough to control your own actions in combat without penalty for the duration, though you still babble incoherently and otherwise behave strangely.\n**Moderate Boon**: Groetus grants you knowledge to further the end times. Each week, he sends you a cryptic, incoherent message about something important to the end times that will happen in the coming week.\n**Major Boon**: Your touch unravels things that have survived past their appointed time, according to Groetus's reckoning. Such a creature or object takes 10d6 negative damage each round you continue touching it; the damage ignores all Hardness and is capable of destroying nonliving objects, creatures immune to negative effects, and even undead or other creatures with negative healing. This boon might even be able to destroy some artifacts that have survived past their time.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Whenever you are illuminated by a light source other than natural sunlight, your head appears to be a bare skull. The DC for your recovery checks is 12 + your dying value, rather than 10 + your dying value, and you don't benefit from effects that reduce the DC, such as from the Toughness feat.\n**Moderate Curse**: The horrors at the end of reality become overwhelming and constantly race through your mind. You are permanently stupefied 2.\n**Major Curse**: You bring about the end to everything around you. Every item you carry or wear gains the broken condition after 10 minutes of exposure to you, and is destroyed after a further hour. This effect can't destroy artifacts or items of similar power.",

Originating in Vudra, the Keeper's faith has slowly gained popularity in the Inner Sea region, particularly in Jalmeray, where Irori already has a wide following.

Impulsive and passionate, his heart moves between joy, sorrow, and anger in the time it takes him to finish his cup, though whatever his mood, he rarely feels it lightly. He may be so moved by a fisher's prayer that he blesses her with a catch large enough to feed her village, while later unleashing torrential waves against that same village for a slight.

Once, when you fail an Intimidation check, you critically succeed instead. Hei Feng grants this boon capriciously based on his mood, sometimes even for trivial or inconsequential boasts, and he sometimes grants it for other skill checks related to boasts.\n**Moderate Boon**: Fair winds and currents speed your passage. Any vessel you use to travel over the sea gains a +10-foot status bonus to its Speeds.\n**Major Boon**: The instruments of the storm spare you from their fury. You ignore all effects and penalties caused by precipitation and winds, and you can see normally through fog, rain, and other weather conditions.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Hei Feng's belligerence hangs over you like a thunderhead. You take a -1 status penalty to checks with Charisma-based skills. If you consume even a drop of alcohol, this penalty becomes -3 until the next sunrise.\n**Moderate Curse**: Your heart is as quick to change as Hei Feng's. If you roll a failure on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical failure instead.\n**Major Curse**: The Duke of Thunder's ire follows you wherever you go. The weather in a 500-foot radius around you is always stormy. Roughly twice each minute you are outside, you are struck by a bolt of lightning that deals 10d6 electricity damage (DC 40 basic Reflex save).",

She was once a mortal gnome who loved the thrill of an exciting wager, up to and including the moment when the dice turned against her. Eventually, Nivi's debts grew too great for her to remain in her surface home, and she fled into the depths of the Darklands to evade the wrath of her creditors. Most of her adventures in the lightless lands are lost to time and history, but she ultimately emerged reborn as a goddess, hailed as the first of the svirfneblin-uncanny underground gnomes with unique magical abilities and immunity to the dread Bleaching, a wasting curse that claims the lives of gnomes who succumb to boredom and ennui.\n\n**Edicts** take risks and savor the consequences whether good or ill, use stealth and guile over violence when dealing with the fallout from your risk-taking, learn the rules and strategies of games of chance played wherever you travel\n**Anathema** break the established rules or terms of a wager, use violence to avoid the consequences of a wager\n**Areas of Concern** gambling, gems, gnomes, stealth\n**Follower Alignments** NG, LN, N, CN\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Dexterity or Intelligence\n**Divine Font** harm or heal\n**Divine Skill** Stealth\n**Favored Weapon** light hammer\n**Domains** family, luck, trickery, wealth\n**Alternate Domains** confidence, earth\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: illusory disguise, 2nd: invisibility, 4th: private sanctum\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nThe Grey Polychrome is a carefree and self-indulgent deity who detests using violence where wits will serve. She rewards cunning in her followers and punishes crudeness.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Those who have earned Nivi's trust are blessed with wild turns of luck in the worst of circumstances. Once, instead of attempting the check you would normally roll, you attempt a DC 11 flat check with the same results. Nivi always grants this boon when the odds are stacked against you (though this same effect is an alternate to her minor curse if she uses it for a check when you would have been very likely to succeed).\n**Moderate Boon**: Nivi bestows a fraction of her skill at pushing consequences down the road. Once per day, after attempting a check, you can roll a second time. You must use the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. This is a fortune effect. At any point after you use this boon, the GM can replace one of your check results with the first result of the check you attempted when using this boon; this delayed result can't be further delayed, prevented, or affected in any way, even by other divine intercessions.\n**Major Boon**: Those who have done much to please Nivi find themselves slipping from sight when needed. Any time you attempt a Stealth check to Hide or Sneak, you also gain the effects of 2nd-level invisibility and fleet step spells to help you elude your enemies. These effects last until the end of your next turn or until you stop Hiding or Sneaking, whichever comes first (you can continue to Hide or Sneak, turn after turn, to extend these effects).\n\n**Minor Curse**: Those who betray Nivi's trust find defeat where there was sure to be victory. Once, when you roll a natural 20 on a die, the result becomes a natural 1 instead. Nivi typically uses this curse for maximum poetic justice.\n**Moderate Curse**: Those who arouse Nivi's wrath find themselves bound to the earth with no place to hide. You are wreathed in constant faerie fire and constantly affected by earthbind, and any effect that grants invisibility doesn't work on you.\n**Major Curse**: Nivi curses unworthy adherents with recklessness. Any time you are presented with a wager, you are compelled to accept, no matter the odds. If you succeed at a DC 40 Will save, you can at least attempt to alter the stakes of that wager in your favor, but you must still accept.",

Those days are behind Nocticula, for she has risen to the role of the Redeemer Queen, a patron of marginalized artists and protector of those cast out from society. She is now feared among her former peers for her persuasive words that tempt them away from their place in the Abyss and toward redemption. Her faith is strongest in the eastern reaches of New Thassilon, where her most powerful exile, Queen Sorshen, seeks to build a nation that welcomes those whom others have cast out.\n\n**Edicts** create art true to yourself, protect marginalized artists, punish those who take advantage of offered trust and shelter\n**Anathema** deny shelter to the desperate, destroy harmless art you dislike, finish a work of art during daylight hours\n**Areas of Concern** artists, exiles, midnight\n**Follower Alignments** CG, N, CN\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Dexterity or Charisma\n**Divine Font** heal\n**Divine Skill** Society\n**Favored Weapon** dagger\n**Domains** change, creation, darkness, travel\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: penumbral shroud, 3rd: nondetection, 4th: creation\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nThe Redeemer Queen smiles upon those who seek to better themselves through introspection, but she is quick to reward betrayal with a stinging rebuke. \n\n\n**Minor Boon**: The night sky inspires you in a specific way.

			"body": "No ancient record reveals the truth of Sivanah's origins; in fact, only recent documents record her existence at all. The Seventh Veil is widely regarded as the goddess of illusion magic, often portrayed as a figure disguised by seven veils. Legends state that each face underneath the first six of her seven veils is of a different ancestry-human, elf, halfling, gnome, anadi, and naga- but the seventh face is never shown, believed to mask the goddess's true form. Some theologians believe Sivanah hails from the Shadow Plane, though the goddess's true nature and form continue to be topics of debate. Even her female visage, while agreed upon by her followers, could likewise be an illusion. Her goals are hidden from even her most faithful, which some believe to have hampered the faith's growth and influence beyond the level of a cult.\n\n**Edicts** show the beauty in illusions, pursue the nature of truth, respect the need for secrets\n**Anathema** use illusions and shadows to harm another creature, reveal a secret you have sworn to keep\n**Areas of Concern** illusions, mysteries, reflections, secrets\n**Follower Alignments** NG, LN, N, CN, NE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Wisdom or Charisma\n**Divine Font** harm or heal\n**Divine Skill** Deception\n**Favored Weapon** bladed scarf\n**Domains** delirium, magic, secrecy, trickery\n**Alternate Domains** glyph\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: illusory disguise, 4th: veil, 5th: shadow siphon\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nThe Seventh Veil abhors the use of illusion to cause harm and detests anyone who discourages or corrupts the process of truth-seeking. The goddess works actively against the faith of Zon-Kuthon and his clerics' use of shadow. \n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Sivanah prevents your enemies from pulling off your veil. Once, when a foe rolls a success on a Perception check to disbelieve your illusion, it gets a critical failure instead. Sivanah typically grants this benefit to protect an elaborate or consequential illusory deception, and she never uses it to improve the effect of a harmful illusion.\n**Moderate Boon**: You wear a veil of illusion wherever you go. You can cast illusory disguise at will as an innate divine spell.\n**Major Boon**: You spread your illusions over a larger area. You can designate an area to permanently gain the effects of hallucinatory terrain. All creatures within this area gain the effects of illusory disguise, changing their forms as you wish. You can designate a new area as a 1-minute activity, but doing so dismisses any previously designated areas.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Your hair becomes a wild variety of colors, which cannot be altered with mundane or magical means, and it somehow grows out from under any cap, scarf, or other headwear intended to disguise it. You gain a -2 status penalty to Deception skill checks to Impersonate anyone else.\n**Moderate Curse**: Those who betray the secrets of others find their own secrets laid bare. Each person from whom you are keeping a secret immediately learns one of your secrets involving that person. This curse doesn't give away other people's secrets you are keeping, only your own.\n**Major Curse**: Mirrors break whenever you cross their paths. You cannot be concealed by illusion magic of any kind (the spell automatically fails), and all creatures that see you know your true identity",

She is revered as the ruler of the Tian pantheon, respected as the finest samurai in Heaven or Golarion, and honored as the patron of nature and emperors alike. Perhaps the most famous tale about her is that of Shizuru and her lover Tsukiyo, the moon god. After Tsukiyo was slain by his brother Fumeiyoshi in a fit of jealousy, Shizuru brought the moon god back to life with the aid of Qi Zhong, the god of medicine. Sadly, Tsukiyo was deeply affected by his experience with death, and though he and Shizuru still love each other, the event created a rift between them. Even so, on the days of an eclipse, they embrace as one.\n\n**Edicts** practice with a weapon every day, honor your ancestors, protect nature and society from corruption and destruction\n**Anathema** abandon a companion in need, dishonor yourself, parlay with truce breakers, separate lovers\n**Areas of Concern** ancestors, honor, the sun, and swordplay\n**Follower Alignments** LG, NG, LN\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Strength or Wisdom\n**Divine Font** heal\n**Divine Skill** Society\n**Favored Weapon** katana\n**Domains** duty, perfection, sun, vigil\n**Alternate Domains** sorrow\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: true strike, 4th: reflective scales, 5th: summon dragon\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nThe Empress of Heaven wastes little time acting coy about her favor. Her boons are often accompanied by beams of sunlight or calligraphic symbols, while her wrath is often signaled by the cracking of precious items and armor.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Your attacks help eradicate darkness. When you successfully Strike a foe, your weapon glows with bright light out to 60 feet for 1 minute. This is a light effect with a counteract level equal to half your level rounded up.\n**Moderate Boon**: Shizuru's light flows through your blade. Your weapons and unarmed attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage or 1d6 good damage; you choose each time you make an attack.\n**Major Boon**: Shizuru bestows upon you a golden suit of armor made from sunlight, or transforms your favorite armor to gain that aspect. Once per hour while you are wearing the armor, if an attack would reduce your Hit Points to 0, the attack is instead completely negated.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Your equipment turns on you for a disgraceful act. The next time you make an attack, your weapon or armor gains the broken condition.\n**Moderate Curse**: Shizuru decrees that her light is no longer your ally. You gain light blindness.\n**Major Curse**: Those who incite Shizuru's personal wrath earn the hatred of all of her subjects. All imperial dragons and animals you encounter are automatically hostile to you, and you gain weakness 15 to draconic breath weapons.",

			"body": "The surface of Golarion's moon is marred with a great scar, and the people of Tian Xia say this is where Tsukiyo, the Prince of the Moon, was struck down by his envious brother Fumeiyoshi. When his lover Shizuru found him the next morning, her tears mixed with his blood to create the first pieces of jade. Shizuru brought him to Qi Zhong, the god of medicine, who resurrected him; but his experience on the other side changed him from a boisterous and carefree soul to a thoughtful and temperamental one. He now sees the world differently from most-something that has strained his relationships and made it difficult for him to relate to others, but has also allowed him to offer his understanding and quiet comfort to those who are lost, demonized, or misunderstood.\n\n**Edicts** provide aid and counsel without judgment to those who seek help, help the dead find their rest, amplify or help speak for the powerless and demonized\n**Anathema** harm another out of envy, force aid on those who do not want it, inflict harmful mental effects on others as punishment\n**Areas of Concern** jade, the moon, spirits\n**Follower Alignments** LG, NG, CG, LN, N\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Constitution or Intelligence\n**Divine Font** heal\n**Divine Skill** Occultism\n**Favored Weapon** spear\n**Domains** delirium, moon, repose, soul\n**Alternate Domains** change\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: soothe, 2nd: mirror image, 5th: hallucination\n\n#### Divine Intercession\nEver mercurial, the Prince of the Moon gives his blessings rarely and somewhat spontaneously. An understanding soul, he is as slow to curse as he is to bless.\n\n\n**Minor Boon**: Tsukiyo's simplest show of gratitude is a gift of clarity. Once, when you roll a failure on a saving throw against a mental effect, you get a critical success instead. Tsukiyo typically grants this boon against a particularly consequential mental effect.\n**Moderate Boon**: Tsukiyo watches over you and guards your sleep. You are guaranteed a peaceful night's rest no matter what conditions you are sleeping in. Even nightmare and similar abilities can't disrupt your sleep unless they come from a deity, artifact, or similarly powerful source.\n**Major Boon**: Tsukiyo shares some of his own nature and can lead a favored soul back along the same path he has walked. The next time you would die, you are instead instantly restored to full health and lose any negative conditions you have.\n\n**Minor Curse**: Those who offend Tsukiyo find that light actively shuns them. You lose any low-light vision or darkvision you have, and you treat all light levels as one step lower.\n**Moderate Curse**: If Tsukiyo is particularly offended by someone, they may find themselves lost in delusions of moonlight. When attempting to navigate or find something at night, if you roll a success or critical success on your Perception check, Survival check, or other check to do so, you get a failure instead.\n**Major Curse**: When Tsukiyo truly loses patience with someone, he forces them to experience the hardships of others firsthand. Whenever you touch another creature or another creature touches you, you immediately gain any negative curses, diseases, and conditions they are suffering. These effects spread to you even when you Strike another creature or a creature Strikes you.",

In his new home in a remote corner of the Shadow Plane, Ranalc embraced his banishment and became the patron of exiles, shadows, betrayal, and the betrayed.

For those falsely accused or who show signs of redemption, she offers a path back to the light. That path is never an easy one, but it is one worth walking, and she stands beside those who make the trek. For the truly wicked and those who show no remorse, she has no mercy. For these reasons, her likeness is often found in courts, where she can watch over and ensure fairness to those accused of crimes. Andoletta also places great value on respect for the dead and the protection of children. To offer solace to the bereaved is true kindness and compassion. Children are slates with tremendous potential for good-if they can be guided and kept safe from evil.\n\nWhen she appears to mortals, Grandmother Crow does so as an older woman, gray-haired, wrinkled, and with keen, knowing eyes. She carries a walking stick and wears a cape of black crow feathers across her shoulders, giving the appearance of large, folded wings.

So long as it doesn't harm others, Arshea believes creatures should do, think, and feel as they will. They encourage their followers to try new things, to think in new ways, and to wear new forms.\n\nWhen appearing to mortals, the Spirit of Abandon most commonly appears in that person's own body so the person may see how beautiful and perfect their own form is-after all, if a divine being has chosen to wear it, it must be perfect.

For the living, she leads the lonely out of their difficult times, her lights guiding lost wanderers back to safety. For the dead, her haunting moonlit dances lead lost and lonely spirits onward to their eternal judgment. She encourages her followers to steer those who are lost-whether in the wilderness or in their hearts-to where they need to go. Priests of Ashava are the dancing light that guides the way, but will-o'-wisps are anathema to Ashava, and her followers destroy these creatures wherever they are found.\n\nThe True Spark appears as a tall woman, flushed with the exertion of prolonged dancing. Her features are difficult to see unless under moonlight, when they instead become crystal clear. She wears a beautiful gown woven from starlight that always sways in motion, and she never appears to be standing still. On her brow she wears a wreath of many-colored moss.

The Black Butterfly finds the silence of the sea of stars useful for introspection and learning about oneself. Those who follow her take opportunities when they can to sit in silent meditation, in zones of silence and darkness when possible. Travel across large distances offers plenty to think about and contemplate, and the Black Butterfly encourages such journeys. She hates all evil, but she truly despises the powerful beings of evil that populate the Dark Tapestry, and her followers are expected to fight these beings and their followers without mercy.\n\nThe Silence Between manifests as the silhouette of a woman with butterfly wings, and white hair and eyes. Her wings contain a shadow-or reflection-of all of the Dark Tapestry and everything within it.

In particular, he believes that although the tireless fight against wickedness is admirable, the ultimate triumph over evil will come in the form of redemption rather than destruction. Korada's dedication to peace is such that he and his followers refuse to cause harm to their attackers, instead using their martial skills only to defend themselves. Many Koradans seek greater wisdom through study or meditation in hopes of better understanding their foes so as to guide them toward redemption. This dedication to self-awareness, philosophy, and introspection is said to have allowed Korada greater insight into the workings of the universe, granting him the great gift of foresight. Korada rarely acts on his visions, however, believing the struggle that comes with true change is always worthwhile, whether or not such a change is successful.\n\nThe Open Hand of Harmony takes the form of a lithe, athletic man donning simple robes. He is covered in sparse, light-brown fur and has three monkey tails that constantly writhe behind him, much like the dancing flames of a powerful fire. Most of Korada's followers are those who have lived imbalanced lives or faced persistent violence as they seek to find peace in their life and within themselves. Many of the evil individuals redeemed by Koradans soon become followers themselves.\n\n**Edicts** Forgive those who have wronged you, embrace a peaceful mindset, seek and allow redemption\n**Anathema** Cause lethal harm to a creature, deny a repentant creature an opportunity for redemption, ask a retired warrior to fight\n**Areas of Concern** foresight, forgiveness, and peace\n**Follower Alignments** NG, N\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Wisdom or Charisma\n**Divine Font** heal\n**Divine Skill** Diplomacy\n**Favored Weapon** fist\n**Domains** change, healing, magic, protection\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: soothe, 3rd: slow, 4th: resilient sphere",

The stories of the constellations not only entertain with tales of goodness and light and strength, but they are also a tool for helping others learn and remember the stars. This ensures that the map in the sky is easy to read and never forgotten. To learn this map and to guide those who are lost or otherwise in need of direction are exceptional callings, but even more so is to teach a petitioner to navigate the skies themself on the journey.\n\nThe Shimmering Maiden is often difficult to see, appearing to mortals from great distances as a bright, hot star. When she can be seen, she has the appearance of a Tian woman whose dark hair twinkles with bright stars. Her green and pink robes appear as though they are made of light, rather than any fabric.

As such, those who stand guard over monuments and ruins are blessed. Likewise, those who study monuments to the past and present with respect, or seek to preserve them for the future, are also blessed. Guardianship of others, but especially of those who study and preserve these relics to the past, is also of great importance to Soralyon. As magic is a valuable tool in guarding, studying, and preserving these monuments and people, Soralyon encourages the study of magic, preferably for use in learning or protection.\n\nWhen the Mystic Angel appears to mortals he usually does so as a handsome being beautifully carved of smooth marble, the hues of which range the entire spectrum of the stone but tend toward those most common locally.

She believes that mysteries lead to truth, but how one arrives at that truth is as important as the answer itself. All questions are puzzles, and all puzzles are worth solving. The more intricate the problem, the more rewarding the investigation, and through determination and ethical investigation, even the deepest of enigmas can be solved. Calculated, logical thinking is more important to Zohls than gut instinct. She sees patterns everywhere, and she teaches that detecting these patterns brings the truth to light. While all investigations are worth pursuing so long as they don't hurt innocents, investigations that reveal the truth of crimes or other horrors, and that lead to justice being served and victims finding peace, are the most important of all to Verity.\n\nWhen appearing to her followers, Verity is always practically dressed, usually wearing a tunic and breeches. She wears black and white clothing, as these colors represent the light of truth and the darkness of obscurity and the unknown. She keeps her light-brown hair pulled back in braids. On her back she has large wings made of parchment that never wrinkle, whether furled or unfurled.

Dying from starvation but elated by his success, Trelmarixian heard a voice call out to him.

Trelmarixian's last mortal memory was of staring into an eclipse.\n\nLyutheria, the original Horseman of Famine, was impressed by Trelmarixian's conquest and took him on as her apprentice, fatally underestimating his ambitions. After Trelmarixian learned all he could from his master, he devoured her and assumed her title.\n\nTrelmarixian appears as sickly man with three snapping jackal heads and putrid, membranous flesh that is constantly dripping and sloughing off his body. As the Horseman of Famine, Trelmarixian ushers in oblivion slowly, watching mortals waste away as their bodies turn against them. He spreads cancer by touch, inciting cells to rebellion, and his breath causes outbreaks of hives and asthma attacks in those nearby. He aligns himself with Szuriel to see that soldiers never make it home to reap their fields, leaving crops to rot on the vine. He collaborates with Apollyon to spread diseases from livestock, rendering butchers' larders barren.

The protean lord of ascendance, keketars, and revelations rarely interacts with non-proteans, but to their protean worshippers, they offer exalted transformations and revelations that can change a being's entire outlook. Worshippers of Narriseminek, both mortal and protean, spend their time divining the future and using magic to transform their bodies-a practice they also extend to any other willing creatures who ask. Their revelations take the form of patterns emerging in otherwise random events; Narriseminek's followers reject astrology and other forms of divination based on predictable cycles.\n\n**Edicts** Divine the future, transform the bodies of willing creatures, rebel against organized structures\n**Anathema** Refuse to speak to a keketar, eschew a challenge by turning down a promotion or an advancement\n**Areas of Concern** ascendance, keketars, and revelations\n**Follower Alignments** CG, CN\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Dexterity or Wisdom\n**Divine Font** harm or heal\n**Divine Skill** Occultism\n**Favored Weapon** hatchet\n**Domains** delirium, freedom, knowledge, perfection\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: mindlink, 4th: confusion, 5th: synesthesia",

The King in Yellow appears as a humanoid figure draped in yellow clothing, but there is nothing within the clothes save a shapeless, horrifying presence. Hastur himself is also referred to as Him Who Is Not To Be Named, or simply the Unspeakable.\n\nSelf-indulgence and nihilism are at the heart of Hastur's worship, and he is popular among debauched artists and nobles who recognize no purpose to life other than gratifying their own increasingly grotesque and outlandish tastes. Cults of Hastur are united in their use of the Yellow Sign, a triskelion design that allows Hastur to observe and possess those who gaze upon it. The presence of the Yellow Sign among a city's graffiti is a foreboding indication that Hastur's attention has been drawn there, and these settlements soon find themselves under attack either by Hastur himself-who seeks to draw cities into Carcosa, fueling his transformation into an Outer God-or by Xhamen-Dor, a parasitic deity spawned by Hastur as he walked Carcosa's sewers.\n\n**Edicts** Spread Hastur's Yellow Sign, hide the true nature of your worship, promulgate the play The King in Yellow\n**Anathema** None\n**Follower Alignments** NE, CE\n\n#### Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Intelligence or Charisma\n**Divine Font** harm\n**Divine Skill** Deception\n**Favored Weapon** rapier\n**Domains** glyph, secrecy, void, wealth\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: illusory disguise, 4th: confusion, 5th: hallucination",

The Crawling Chaos, as he is also known, appears humanlike not because he identifies with mortal concerns or cares for his mortal followers, but because a mortal shape makes it easier for him to do his work: spreading the influence of the Outer Gods.\n\nIn his role as a herald, messenger, and agent provocateur for the Outer Gods, Nyarlathotep is the Outer God most likely to have direct interactions with mortals. He answers prayers, teaches evil magic, and inserts himself into history-all to enable mortal cruelty, facilitate the release of Great Old Ones, and turn whole societies toward worship of the Outer Gods. He was instrumental in the fall of Ancient Osirion, and some believe he led Taldor to launch the Armies of Exploration, a glorious folly that proved the ruin of that empire. There are countless tales of his interaction with (and often possession of) mortal cultists and magicians who dare to call upon him, and they all end in grotesque corruption and death.

Her followers are sadists, torturers who relish their grisly work, and those diabolists who summon velstracs rather than devils.
